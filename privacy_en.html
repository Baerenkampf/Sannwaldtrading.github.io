  <h2>Data Collected</h2>
  <p>
    Our browser app does not collect any personal or technical data. Neither IP addresses, browser information, search histories, nor any other usage data are recorded or stored. The app is used completely anonymously, and no cookies or similar tracking technologies are used for data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of Data Management</h2>
  <p>
    Since no data is collected, no data processing occurs. All app functions run locally on your device without transferring any information to external servers. Therefore, no data analysis, evaluation, or further processing is necessary.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>
    Because no personal data is processed, no data processing takes place under the GDPR. The app is provided solely for the fulfillment of the contract or the provision of the requested services.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Since no data is stored, there is no storage period or deletion policy. All information generated during use remains exclusively on your device and is not centrally recorded or secured.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    No data is shared with third parties because no personal or technical data is collected or stored.
  </p>

  <h2>Transfer to Third Countries</h2>
  <p>
    There is no transfer of data to third countries, as no data is collected or processed.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Our app does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies. No information is collected for analytical or advertising purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since no personal data is processed, users cannot directly exercise their GDPR rights (e.g. access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, objection, data portability). If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>Security Measures</h2>
  <p>
    Even though no data is collected, we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the integrity and functionality of the app and to prevent unauthorized access.
